# Future Storage - Filecoin Plus DataCap Allocator - Client Applications

Welcome to the GitHub repository designed for managing Lifecycle Data Notations (LDN) Applications for a dedicated Filecoin Plus DataCap allocator team. This repository functions as a transparent public ledger for tracking DataCap allocation requests, promoting both transparency and efficiency.

## Overview

Filecoin Plus (Fil+) extends the capabilities of Filecoin by not only storing data but also verifying its utility. DataCap is distributed to clients based on their storage requirements and the value their data adds to the Filecoin network. Our team, operating via a shared multisig wallet, serves as the DataCap allocator, assessing and validating client requests.

## How It Works

Instead of serving as a traditional code repository, this GitHub repo acts as an organized ledger to handle DataCap requests through Client Applications. Every step of each application, from request to allocation, is documented publicly here.

### Requesting DataCap

1. **Open an Issue:** Clients seeking DataCap must create a new issue in this repository. The issue should contain comprehensive details about the project needing DataCap. Essential information includes, but is not limited to:
   - Project name and description
   - Amount of DataCap requested
   - Justification for the requested DataCap
   - Data owner information for KYC purposes

2. **Complete the Application Template:** An issue template will guide clients in submitting the necessary information for their DataCap request.

### Review and Allocation Process

1. **Initial Review:** Upon issue creation, our allocator team will perform an initial review to verify that all required information is included.
2. **Discussion & Clarification:** The team may engage in discussions within the issue thread to request clarifications or additional details.
3. **Decision:** The allocator team will decide on the DataCap request. If approved, the request moves to the allocation phase.

### Managing the Client Application Lifecycle

- Each Client Application's lifecycle is documented through a `.json` file in this repository, uniquely linked to the client's issue.
- The `.json` file is created when an application is first approved for allocation and is updated through pull requests as more DataCap is allocated or as the application's status changes.
- This systematic approach ensures transparency and traceability for both clients and the allocator team.
